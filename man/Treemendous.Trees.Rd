\description{
A dataset containing tree species assembled from six different publicly available datasets:
\itemize{
\item \strong{BGCI} (Botanical Gardens Conservation Internation): \emph{GlobalTreeSearch}, Version \code{1.6} (April, 2022), \href{https://tools.bgci.org/global_tree_search.php}{Source}
\item \strong{WFO} (World Flora Online): \emph{Taxonomic Backbone}, Version \code{v.2022.04} (April, 2022), \href{http://www.worldfloraonline.org/downloadData}{Source}
\item \strong{WCVP} (World Checklist of Vascular Plants): Version \code{v8} (March, 2022), \href{https://wcvp.science.kew.org/}{Source}
\item \strong{GBIF} (Global Biodiversity Information Facility): Version (November, 2021), \href{https://hosted-datasets.gbif.org/datasets/backbone/}{Source}
\item \strong{FIA} (Forest Inventory and Analysis): Version \code{9.1}, \href{https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/library/field-guides-methods-proc/index.php}{Source}
\item \strong{PhyloMaker (PM)} (Phylogenetic megatree GBOTB.extended from R package \emph{V.PhyloMaker}): Package version \verb{0.1.0} \href{https://github.com/jinyizju/V.PhyloMaker}{Source}
}

\emph{Treemendous} matches and resolves synonyms according to the dataset \code{Treemendous.Trees}, allowing the user always to specify a subset of the six backbones if desired.

\details{
See the publication accompanying the \emph{Treemendous} package for more details. TODO: insert link to publication / pre-print.

The code for how the backbones were curated and merged is available in the package source code under \code{data-raw/Treemendous-Trees.R}.

Although all information about the taxonomic family of species (\code{WFO_Family}, \code{WCVP_Family}, \code{GBIF_Family}, \code{PM_Family}),
as well as the scientific authorship (\code{WFO_Authors}, \code{WCVP_Authors}, \code{GBIF_Authors}, \code{BGCI_Authors}), is not used by
the functionality of the package so far, we decided to keep the information out of the following reasons.
First, it allows a user to further investigate matched names and allows for manual a assessment of whether a match was reasonable or not.
Second, the unused information is likely to be used for future functionalities of the \emph{Treemendous} package.
For instance, we plan to let \emph{Treemendous} interact with the \emph{V.PhyloMaker} package to get species phylogenies, a common analysis performed in ecological research.
\emph{V.PhyloMaker} requires the user to inpu the taxonomic family, which could be resolved using the information about taxonomic families in \code{Treemendous.Trees}.
Further, if a user has access to information about the scientific authorship, future versions might consider this in cases of ambiguous matches, and could help resolving these.
