\title{Database used by Treemendous to standardize Species Names}
\format{
A data frame with 414295 species and 35 variables:
\describe{
\item{Genus}{Genus name of species binomial}
\item{Species}{Specific epithet of species binomial}
\item{BGCI}{Boolean indicator whether this species was present in the \code{BGCI} backbone}
\item{WFO}{Boolean indicator whether this species was present in the \code{WFO} backbone}
\item{WCVP}{Boolean indicator whether this species was present in the \code{WCVP} backbone}
\item{GBIF}{Boolean indicator whether this species was present in the \code{GBIF} backbone}
\item{BGCI_Authors}{Information about authors based on \code{BGCI}}
\item{WFO_ID}{Unique ID in \code{WFO}}
\item{WFO_accepted_ID}{Unique ID of accepted species in \code{WFO}}
\item{WFO_Status}{Status according to \code{WFO}: e.g. Synonym, Accepted}
\item{WFO_Authors}{Information about authors based on \code{WFO}}
\item{WFO_Rank}{Taxonomic rank the species: one of \verb{c('Species, Subspecies, Variety, Form)}}
\item{WFO_Family}{Taxonomical family as specified by \code{WFO}}
\item{WFO_Infraspecific}{Infraspecific epithet of the corresponding entry in \code{WFO}}
\item{WFO_Flag}{Indicates whether multiple entries with identical latin binomials were present in the original \strong{WFO} database, which would be resolved to different latin binomials in \code{resolve_synonyms()}.
"Authorship ambiguity": Two or more entries at rank \code{Species} with different authorship would be resolved to different latin binomials.
"Infraspecific ambiguituy": Two or more entries at infraspecific levels would be resolved to different latin binomials.}
\item{WFO_new_linkage}{Boolean indicator whether \code{WCVP_accepted_ID} was relinked to another entry in \code{Treemendous.Trees} with the same latin binomial. This was necessary because our database design only allowed for one entry for every unique latin binomial. }
\item{WCVP_ID}{Unique ID in \code{WCVP}}
\item{WCVP_accepted_ID}{Unique ID of accepted species in \code{WCVP}}
\item{WCVP_Status}{Status according to \code{WCVP}: e.g. Synonym, Accepted}
\item{WCVP_Authors}{Information about authors based on \code{WCVP}}
\item{WCVP_Rank}{Taxonomic rank the species: one of \verb{c('Species, Subspecies, Variety, Form)}}
\item{WCVP_Family}{Taxonomical family as specified by \code{WCVP}}
\item{WCVP_Infraspecific}{Infraspecific epithet of the corresponding entry in \code{WCVP}}
\item{WCVP_Flag}{See \code{WFO_Flag} above.}
\item{WCVP_new_linkage}{See \code{WFO_new_linkage} above.}
\item{GBIF_ID}{Unique ID in \code{GBIF}}
\item{GBIF_accepted_ID}{Unique ID of accepted species in \code{GBIF}}
\item{GBIF_Status}{Status according to \code{GBIF}: e.g. Synonym, Accepted}
\item{GBIF_Authors}{Information about authors based on \code{GBIF}}
\item{GBIF_Rank}{Taxonomic rank the species: one of \verb{c('Species, Subspecies, Variety, Form)}}
\item{GBIF_Family}{Taxonomical family as specified by \code{GBIF}}
\item{GBIF_Infraspecific}{Infraspecific epithet of the corresponding entry in \code{GBIF}}
\item{GBIF_Flag}{See \code{WFO_Flag} above.}
\item{GBIF_new_linkage}{See \code{WFO_new_linkage} above.}
\item{ID_merged}{Unique ID assigned to each species in \code{Treemendous.Trees}. Note that these ID's are currently not ensured to be consistent between subsequent versions of the package.}

\description{
A dataset containing tree species assembled from four different publicly available datasets:
\itemize{
\item \strong{BGCI} (Botanical Gardens Conservation Internation): \emph{GlobalTreeSearch}, Version \code{1.6} (April, 2022), \href{https://tools.bgci.org/global_tree_search.php}{Source}
\item \strong{WFO} (World Flora Online): \emph{Taxonomic Backbone}, Version \code{v.2022.07} (July, 2022), \href{http://www.worldfloraonline.org/downloadData}{Source}
\item \strong{WCVP} (World Checklist of Vascular Plants): Version \code{v9} (June, 2022), \href{http://sftp.kew.org/pub/data-repositories/WCVP/Archive/}{Source}
\item \strong{GBIF} (Global Biodiversity Information Facility): Version (November, 2021), \href{https://hosted-datasets.gbif.org/datasets/backbone/}{Source}
}

\emph{Treemendous} matches and resolves synonyms according to the dataset \code{Treemendous.Trees}, allowing the user always to specify a subset of the backbones if desired.
}
\details{
See the publication accompanying the \emph{Treemendous} package for more details. TODO: insert link to publication / pre-print.

The code for how the backbones were curated and merged is available in the package source code under \code{data-raw/Treemendous-Trees.R}.

Although all information about the taxonomic family of species (\code{WFO_Family}, \code{WCVP_Family}, \code{GBIF_Family}),
as well as the scientific authorship (\code{WFO_Authors}, \code{WCVP_Authors}, \code{GBIF_Authors}, \code{BGCI_Authors}), is not used by
the functionality of the package so far, we decided to keep the information out of the following reasons.
First, it allows a user to further investigate matched names and allows for manual a assessment of whether a match was reasonable or not.
Second, the unused information is likely to be used for future functionalities of the \emph{Treemendous} package.
For instance, we plan to let \emph{Treemendous} interact with the \emph{V.PhyloMaker2} package to get species phylogenies, a common analysis performed in ecological research.
\emph{V.PhyloMaker2} requires the user to input the taxonomic family, which could be resolved using the information about taxonomic families in \code{Treemendous.Trees}.
Further, if a user has access to information about the scientific authorship, future versions might consider this in cases of ambiguous matches, and could help resolving these.
