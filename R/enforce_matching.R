#' Enforce Matching for Unmatched Species According to a Specified Backbone
#'
#' @description
#' `enforce_matching()` can be called after `matching()`.
#' The function tries to match all unmatched species, by making use of the synonym-accepted relations present in the backbones `WFO`, `WCVP` and `GBIF`.
#' A graph connecting all synonyms with accepted species is created and used to look for matches at increasing distance in this graph according to the desired backbone.
#'
#' @details
#' This function is useful when you want to increase the proportion of matched species against a single target backbone.
#' The package _igraph_ is used to create an undirected graph `g` connecting all synonyms with accepted species according the databases `WFO`, `WCVP` and `GBIF`.
#' Edges represent species names, and vertices represent synonym-accepted relations between two species according to at least one backbone.
#' From the output of `matching()`, all unmatched species are matched to all three backbones via `matching(c('WFO', 'WCVP', 'GBIF'))`.
#' If there is a match, then all neighbors in the graph `g` of the matched species are checked if they belong to the target backbone.
#' The neighbors are also allowed to not directly match, but match according to `matching(target_backbone)` (fuzzy matches, suffix matches).
#' This is repeated for neighbors in the graph `g` up to a distance of three, which is also returned as `enforced_matching_dist` for successful matches. .
#'
#'
#' @param df `tibble` which is the output of `matching()` or `sequential_matching()` and therefor contains the columns `Matched.Genus` and `Matched.Species`. May contain additional columns, which will be ignored.
#' @param backbone specifies which backbone is used: needs to be one of `c('BGCI', 'WCVP', 'WFO', 'GBIF')`.
#' @param target_df is used if the user wants to provide a custom target dataset. The parameter is intended only for compatibility with the function translate_trees and should not be directly used.
#'
#' @return
#' A `tibble` with matched species in `Matched.Genus` and `Matched.Species`.
#' Along with the process information of `matching()`, the function returns the logical column `enforced_matched`, stating whether the species was successfully matched by `enforce_matching()`, and the distance in the neighborhood graph `g`.
