#' @title Database used by Treemendous to standardize Species Names
#'
#' @description A dataset containing tree species assembled from six different publicly available datasets:
#'
#' - **BGCI** (Botanical Gardens Conservation Internation): _GlobalTreeSearch_, Version `1.6` (April, 2022), [Source](https://tools.bgci.org/global_tree_search.php)
#' - **WFO** (World Flora Online): _Taxonomic Backbone_, Version `v.2022.07` (July, 2022), [Source](http://www.worldfloraonline.org/downloadData)
#' - **WCVP** (World Checklist of Vascular Plants): Version `v9` (June, 2022), [Source](http://sftp.kew.org/pub/data-repositories/WCVP/Archive/)
#' - **GBIF** (Global Biodiversity Information Facility): Version (November, 2021), [Source](https://hosted-datasets.gbif.org/datasets/backbone/)
#' - **FIA** (Forest Inventory and Analysis): Version `9.1`, [Source](https://www.fia.fs.usda.gov/library/field-guides-methods-proc/index.php)
#' - **PhyloMaker (PM)** (Phylogenetic megatree GBOTB.extended from R package _V.PhyloMaker_): Package version `0.1.0` [Source](https://github.com/jinyizju/V.PhyloMaker)
#'
#' _Treemendous_ matches and resolves synonyms according to the dataset `Treemendous.Trees`, allowing the user always to specify a subset of the six backbones if desired.
#' @details
#' See the publication accompanying the _Treemendous_ package for more details. TODO: insert link to publication / pre-print.
#'
#' The code for how the backbones were curated and merged is available in the package source code under `data-raw/Treemendous-Trees.R`.
#'
#' Although all information about the taxonomic family of species (`WFO_Family`, `WCVP_Family`, `GBIF_Family`, `PM_Family`),
#' as well as the scientific authorship (`WFO_Authors`, `WCVP_Authors`, `GBIF_Authors`, `BGCI_Authors`), is not used by
#' the functionality of the package so far, we decided to keep the information out of the following reasons.
#' First, it allows a user to further investigate matched names and allows for manual a assessment of whether a match was reasonable or not.
#' Second, the unused information is likely to be used for future functionalities of the _Treemendous_ package.
#' For instance, we plan to let _Treemendous_ interact with the _V.PhyloMaker_ package to get species phylogenies, a common analysis performed in ecological research.
#' _V.PhyloMaker_ requires the user to inpu the taxonomic family, which could be resolved using the information about taxonomic families in `Treemendous.Trees`.
#' Further, if a user has access to information about the scientific authorship, future versions might consider this in cases of ambiguous matches, and could help resolving these.
