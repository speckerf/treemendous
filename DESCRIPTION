Description: Treemendous is an R package for standardizing taxonomical names of 
tree species. The package comes along with the comprehensive dataset of trees 
species Treemendous.Trees, compiled from six different publicly available backbones. 
The package consists of two main functionalities:  First, the user can match tree 
species names against the Treemendous.Trees database. Second, matched species names 
can be resolved to their corresponding accepted species names.  The user can always 
specify which backbone of the Treemendous.Trees dataset should be considered during 
the pipelines.
