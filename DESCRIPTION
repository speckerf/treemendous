Description: Treemendous is an R package for standardizing taxonomical names of tree species. 
The package comes along with the comprehensive dataset of trees species _Treemendous.Trees_, compiled from six different publicly available backbones.
The package consists of two main functionalities: 
First, the user can match tree species names against the _Treemendous.Trees_ database.
Second, matched species names can be resolved to their corresponding accepted species names. 
The user can always specify which backbone of the _Treemendous.Trees_ dataset should be considered during the pipelines.
