Description: Treemendous is an open-source software package for the R programming environment that 
    provides a toolset for standardizing tree species names according to four publicly 
    available backbones: World Flora Online (WFO), the Botanical Gardens Convention 
    International (BGCI), the World Consensus on Vascular Plants (WCVP) and the Global 
    Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The 
    package simultaneously leverages information and relationships across all these 
    backbones to increase matching rates and minimize data loss, while ensuring the 
    resulting species are accepted and consistent with a single reference backbone. The package
    provides a flexible workflow depending on the use case, in which users can 
    chain together different functionalities ranging from simple matching to a single 
    backbone, to graph-based iterative matching using synonym-accepted relations across 
    all backbones in the database. In addition, the package allows users to `translate' 
    one tree species list into another, streamlining the assimilation of new data into 
    preexisting datasets or models.
